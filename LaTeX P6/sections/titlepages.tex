}{% the abstract
  The rising development in automation has lead to the almost unprecedented surge of electric autonomous vehicles. To better understand the technologies used in the fields of autonomous vehicles and the smaller scale mobile robotics, this project was carried out.
A model describing and analysing the behaviour of a differential drive robot was created, alongside a theoretical PID controller. 
The application was conducted on a described set of hardware, which was later programmed using the Raspberry Pi platform. The development process includes basic software and leads to the implementation of obstacle avoidance
