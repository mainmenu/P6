\chapter{Conclusion and Future Development}\label{ch:conclusion}

Throughout this project, knowledge was obtained in the field of mobile robotics, by developing a differential drive robot. Modelling and simulation was performed, in order to understand the behaviour of the system, as well as to design a theoretical controller for cruise control.
The platform used for the implementation is a Raspberry Pi and the software was developed in Python. Through a set of ultrasonic sensors the robot was capable of navigating, yet avoiding obstacles. Due to project limitations, at the completion of this report, not all desired functions were implemented in the system. Namely, with the absence of working optical encoders, it was not possible to test the theoretical controller. Nevertheless, after the acquiring of the necessary components, an update would be performed on the development part of this paper.
