\paragraph{Hardware in the device} 



In the following chapter we will see what hardware we have used to produce this device.
First we decided on what platform we will be working on.

\section{Single board computer} 

Since we were allready familiar with the Raspberry Pi singleboard computer we decided that it is best to continue with the system we are allready know how to operate.
At first we used the Raspberry Pi 2 model B but in concideration of the power supply and performance we swapped it out with a Raspberry Zero.

\end{figure}

We chose the Rasperry Pi Zero over the Raspberry Pi 2B because of the lesser power consumption and the size.
Performance of the two computers are similar. 
Zero has less RAM but in our project it does not have a significant impact.

Specs of the Raspberry Pi Zero:
1Ghz, Single-core CPU
512MB RAM
Mini HDMI and USB On-The-Go ports
Micro USB power
HAT-compatible 40-pin header
Composite video and reset headers



\section{Distance measuring} 

Since our device would be avoiding obstacles on the way it is fitted with distance measuring sensors.
We have decided to use ultra sonic sensors.
Concidering the cost and the performance we are looking for we eventually settled on the HC-SR04 ultra sonic sensor.
In our device we have used three of those sensors in orded to cover the front side of the veichle.

\section{DC motors and the chassie} 

We are using a premade complect of two DC motors and the chassie with the wheels.
Each of the motors are connected to the wheels directly.

\label{fig::chassie}
\end{figure}

Motor specs:

 Voltage:
DC 3V
DC 5V
DC 6V
Current:
100 MA
100MA
120MA
Reduction rate:48:1
RPM (With tire):100,190,240
Tire Diameter:66mm
Car Speed(M/minute):20,39,48

Motor Weight (g):50

Motor Size:70mm*22mm*18mm

Noise:<65dB 

The two motors are identical and are used to move the device and to steer aswell

\section{Motor driver} 

At the beginning of the project we used a L9110S DC Stepper Motor Driver H-Bridge for controlling the movement of the wheels, but as we soon dicovered the suggested driver was not capable of regulating the motor speeds.
To controll the speed of the veichle we then swapped it to the L298N driver.
The second driver was capable of using the PWM to regulate the speed of the motors.
