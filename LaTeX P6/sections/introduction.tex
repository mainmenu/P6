\paragraph{The Future of Vehicle Automation} 

In recent years, a big emphasis has been put on the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous ground vehicles. It comes as no surprise considering it is no longer a question of \textit{will} this technology be implemented, but rather \textit{when}.\todo{citation needed}The benefits of autonomous vehicle integration can be considered invaluable. Currently 90\% of motor vehicle fatalities are estimated to be due to human errors \todo{citation needed}, meaning that vehicle automation could result in substantial decrease of accidents. Furthermore, depending on the percentage of autonomous vehicles on the roads, a research concluded, a drastic reduction in traffic and congestions .\todo{citation needed} 

Nonetheless, there is still much work to be done in perfecting the control as well as the sensing capabilities of autonomous ground vehicles, if they are to become the default means of automotive transportation. Some of the issues consist of environmental conditions, which may disturb the sensors accuracy; precise mapping awareness, such as live maps that update when there is ongoing maintenance of infrastructure etc.; improved sensing capabilities (e.g advanced lidars) that can differentiate road damage, liquid spills etc.; ethical choices (as when an accident cannot be avoided), choosing to minimize potential damage and avoid casualties.

\subparagraph{Levels of Automation} 

Automated vehicles, as defined by the \textit{National Highway Traffic Safety Administration}(NHTSA - USA), are ones in which at least some aspects of a safety-critical control function occurs without the operator's direct input.(e.g steering, throttle,braking etc.)\todo{citation Automated Vehicle Policy,pdf} As such they are classified by the \textbf{NHTSA} in five levels:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Level 0 - No Automation} \\
Logically, this level does not include any direct automation functions, however it may include some warning systems such as blind spot monitoring. The operator has the complete control over the vehicle.\todo{Citation from pdf for the whole list} 
\item \textbf{Level 1 - Function Specific Automation} \\
The system may utilize one or more control functions operating independently from each other, such as cruise control or dynamic brake support. Nevertheless the driver has over control and can limit the functions of the supported aid systems.
\item \textbf{Level 2 - Combined Function Automation} \\
The system utilizes at least two primary control functions, intercommunicating with each other in order to allow the operator's disengagement from physical operation of the vehicle. An example of such is a combination between \textit{adaptive cruise control} and \textit{lane centering}. The driver is still responsible for monitoring the environment, even when automated operating mode is enabled.
\item \textbf{Level 3 - Limited Self-Driving Automation} \\
The driver accepts to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain conditions, and rely completely on the vehicle to monitor the environment if a transition toward manual control is required. Such level of control is observed in automated or self-driving vehicles that conclude when the system is unable to handle an environment, such as road construction site, requiring specific manoeuvres. The driver is not expected to fully pay attention to the road, but is advised to pay attention to sudden changes.
\item \textbf{Level 4 - Full Self-Driving Automation} \\
Vehicle is designed to solely operate all safety-critical functions and supervise road conditions. Apart from providing destination input, the driver is not expected to maintain control at any point of the trip.

\section{Examples}
You can also have examples in your document such as in example~\ref{ex:simple_example}.
\begin{example}{An Example of an Example}
  \label{ex:simple_example}
  Here is an example with some math
  \begin{equation}
    0 = \exp(i\pi)+1\ .
  \end{equation}
  You can adjust the colour and the line width in the {\tt macros.tex} file.

\section{How Does Sections, Subsections, and Subsections Look?}
Well, like this
\subsection{This is a Subsection}
and this

and this.

\paragraph{A Paragraph}
You can also use paragraph titles which look like this.

\subparagraph{A Subparagraph} Moreover, you can also use subparagraph titles which look like this\todo{Is it possible to add a subsubparagraph?}. They have a small indentation as opposed to the paragraph titles.

\todo[inline,color=green]{I think that a summary of this exciting chapter should be added.}
